## üìå Project Overview

The **Vendor Performance Dashboard** is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report developed to address key business challenges. The analysis was conducted on multiple Excel files containing over 1,00,00,000 rows of data.

Effective inventory and sales management are essential for maximizing profitability in the retail and wholesale sectors. This project helps businesses ensure they are not losing revenue due to inefficient pricing strategies, slow inventory turnover, or over-reliance on specific vendors.

### ‚úÖ Key Objectives:
- **Identify** underperforming brands that may need promotional or pricing adjustments.
- **Determine** top-performing vendors contributing significantly to sales and gross profit.
- **Analyze** the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
- **Assess** inventory turnover rates to reduce holding costs and improve operational efficiency.
- **Investigate** profitability variance between high-performing and low-performing vendors.
