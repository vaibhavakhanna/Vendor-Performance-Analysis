    3. Database created to store downloaded csv files 
    4. Logging - to record every executed events 
    5. EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) - to understand the data and created summary table for analysis, containing - purchase         transactions made by vendors, sales, transaction data, freight cost of each vendor, actual product prices
